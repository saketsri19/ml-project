This project is a web-based application designed to predict stock prices based on user-provided input values. The interface allows users to enter critical stock data, such as the opening price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume of a stock for a given time frame. The application processes this data and provides a prediction of the stock's price, leveraging a pre-trained machine learning model on the backend.

Key Features:
User Input Form:
A clean and intuitive form captures stock data from the user, including:

Opening Value
Highest Value
Lowest Value
Volume
Dynamic Styling:
The user interface is visually appealing, with a background image, a modern and responsive layout, and enhanced styles such as:

Semi-transparent containers for better readability.
Animated buttons with hover effects for improved interactivity.
Golden highlights for a professional and elegant aesthetic.
Real-Time Predictions:

On submission, the backend processes the input data and predicts the stock price.
The result is dynamically displayed in a highlighted section for easy visibility.
Math.floor Integration:
The prediction output is rounded down to the nearest whole number using the math.floor function, ensuring the result is presented as an integer value.

Responsive Design:
The application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices like desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Purpose and Applications:
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be integrated with web applications for predictive analytics. Its potential use cases include:

Educational Tools: Teaching the basics of financial forecasting.
Business Applications: Assisting small investors or businesses in decision-making.
Prototype Development: Serving as a foundation for more sophisticated financial modeling tools.
Technical Highlights:
Frontend: Designed using HTML and CSS for structure and styling, enhanced by Django template language for dynamic content rendering.
Backend: Powered by Django to handle form submissions, process inputs, and render predictions.
Machine Learning Integration: A trained model predicts stock prices using historical data patterns.
Deployment-Ready: The application can be deployed on any Django-compatible server.
This project is a stepping stone toward building advanced financial forecasting tools while showcasing an elegant and interactive user experience# ml-project
